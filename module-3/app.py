    This tool helps you quickly scan files to check if they might be risky before uploading or sharing.

    - File extension validation (only common safe types allowed)
    - MIME type verification (checks actual file content)
    - Entropy analysis (detects files that may be encrypted or obfuscated)
    
    Upload a file below to see if it passes these security checks.
